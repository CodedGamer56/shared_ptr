# shared_ptr

I wrote this library to get an understanding about shared_ptrs and try creating my own version of them for no obivious reason. I wouldn't really recommend you to use this library in any of your personal projects (in fact, don't ever do that), since this is not more efficient than the canonical one but if you would like to know how shared_ptrs work, this might be the right place.

### **Use this library**

- If you want to test or make changes to this library, you can copy the src/shared_ptr.hpp file and work on it. 
- You could also clone this repository entirely and then run the premake5.lua script to generate project files for your desired VS IDE version (VS2019 is recommended).
